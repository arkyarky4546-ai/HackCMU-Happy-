"""User corrections to inferred phrase boundaries.

Segmentation is inference, and it reports its own confidence — often 0.3 to 0.5
on continuous etude writing, because the evidence genuinely is thin there. A
player who can see a boundary in the wrong place needs a way to say so; without
one, the honest confidence number is just an apology.

Two operations, both at measure boundaries: split a phrase in two, and merge a
phrase with the one after it. Boundaries inside a measure are supported by the
data model — anchors carry a note index — but not yet by this interface, and
saying that plainly is better than implying otherwise.

The invariant every edit preserves, enforced by tests:
structural phrase coverage tiles the analyzable music with no gaps and no
duplicate ownership. Practice ranges may overlap; structural ranges may not.
A phrase list is therefore always rebuilt from a partition of measure indices
rather than patched in place, because patching is how a gap gets introduced.
