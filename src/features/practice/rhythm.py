"""Complementary rhythm variation, computed exactly and refused when unsafe.

The transformation is the one described in source S01: take a run of equal
notes and alternately lengthen and
shorten consecutive pairs, then reverse the pattern. The point is that each pair
still occupies exactly the time it occupies on the page, so the beat does not
move and the exercise can be played against the rest of the phrase.

Two rules keep this from becoming a blind pairwise rewrite, which the pedagogy
document explicitly forbids:

* Every refusal is by name. Ties, rests, tuplets, mixed values, an unreadable
  measure or a value too short to halve all mean "not this technique here",
  never "transform it anyway and hope".
* Duration is arithmetic on Fractions, never floats, and the total is asserted
  unchanged. A variation that quietly stole a 64th from the bar would push
  everything after it off the beat.
