"""Left-hand demands estimated from pitch alone, and labelled as estimates.

The notation does not print where a note is played, so by design
Chordially must not *assert* a shift, a string or a fingering the page does not
establish, and the rubric honours that: nothing here is reported as what the
player does. What it reports is what the pitches *require at minimum* under one
disclosed model -- the lowest workable position -- which is the reading a
teacher grading a piece for a syllabus uses too. A passage that a virtuoso
would keep on one string in a high position is counted here as crossings in a
low position; that alternative is also demanding, so the estimate is a floor on
the work, not a claim about the fingering.

Three quantities come out of the model, and every one of them names a demand
that graded violin syllabi grade by:

* **Likely string** -- the highest open string at or below the pitch -- and
  from it the string crossings between consecutive notes. Fluency in string
  crossing is what separates a level 3 study from a level 2 one in the ASTA
  descriptions, and until now the rubric could not see it at all.
* **Minimum position**, from the pitch a fourth finger can reach in each
  position on the E string, and from it the position changes between
  consecutive notes. "Some shifting to third position" and "shifting through
  fifth position" are how the ASTACAP levels describe themselves.
* **Double-stop hardness**, from the interval and whether an open string is
  involved. A fingered third is a different problem from a melody over an open
  D, and every double-stop method treats them as different problems.

Fingering systems that solve this properly (Viterbi over string, finger and
position with costs for shifts and crossings) exist; this is deliberately the
cheap monotone version, because "light processing" is a constraint of the
product and because a rating should be explainable in a sentence.
