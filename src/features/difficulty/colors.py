"""Difficulty-to-colour mapping for the 0.0–10.0 rating scale.

The progression is light green -> yellow -> orange -> red -> near-black, evenly
spaced at 2.5 points. Values between anchors are interpolated linearly in sRGB.
Linear sRGB interpolation is chosen over a perceptual space deliberately: the
spec pins exact hex values, and any perceptual blend would fail to reproduce
them between anchors. The anchors themselves are reproduced exactly.

The anchors sit on a 2.5 grid while the categories cut at 2.0, so a category
spans part of two ramps rather than exactly one. That is deliberate: the
progression is the one the product asked for, and bending it onto the category
grid would have meant inventing a sixth colour nobody specified.

The scale is absolute and identical for every score. A beginner etude occupies
the light-green end and stays there; nothing is stretched to make one piece use
the whole ribbon.

Category labels use half-open intervals, so
a score of exactly 2.0 is "Advanced Beginner", not "Beginner-friendly". The
final interval is closed so 10.0 has a home.

Unrated is not a colour on this scale. It gets neutral hatching, because the
spec requires unreadable content to stay visually distinct from both easy and
difficult content.
