"""The 0.0-10.0 difficulty rubric. Deterministic, explainable, and heuristic.

What this is: a transparent product heuristic that estimates how demanding a
passage is to play, under a stated tempo, from features that are actually
visible in the notation.

What it is not: a measurement of anyone's proficiency, and not a validated
examination grade. No source cited here
establishes a numeric scale; the sources support individual practice techniques,
not this number. The one decimal place is for ordering and comparison, not a
claim of precision.

Design rules that the tests enforce:

* Identical validated input and settings produce an identical rating.
* A measure that could not be analyzed is unrated (None), never 0.0. Zero means
  genuinely easy; None means unknown, and the two must look different.
* Recognition confidence never multiplies difficulty. A blurry easy measure is
  easy, not hard.
* Nothing asserts a shift, a string choice, or a fingering that the notation
  does not establish. Features are named for what is printed.
* The scale is absolute and shared across pieces. No piece is normalized to
  fill it; a beginner etude is supposed to sit near the bottom of a scale whose
  top belongs to concerto writing.

Version 2.0 rewrote the features after measuring version 1.0 against the
Wohlfahrt fixture, where straightforward first-position eighth-note studies were
coming out at 3.2-5.1 -- "Advanced Beginner" to "Competent level" for music
printed as the second study in a beginner's book. Seven separate causes were
found and each is fixed at its source rather than by subtracting a constant:

1.  **Ordinary off-beat notes were counted as syncopation.** Every second
    eighth note in 4/4 sits off the quarter-note beat, so straight eighths
    scored 0.50 and straight sixteenths 0.75 on a feature meant to detect
    displaced accents. Syncopation now requires an accent actually displaced:
    an off-beat attack that sustains through the next beat, is tied across it,
    or replaces a beat the composer left silent.
2.  **Key-signature notes were charged as accidentals.** The MusicXML path
    reports sounding alteration, so every F# in a G-major piece read as a
    printed accidental. Accidentals are now what differs from the key
    signature, which is the definition a musician would use.
3.  **First position was treated as high register.** The old ceiling for "no
    register demand" was E5, the open E string. First position reaches B5 with
    the fourth finger, so normal first-position writing was charged up to 1.54
    points. The threshold is now B5 and the ramp above it is continuous.
4.  **Routine slurs were charged as bow demand.** Any note under any slur
    counted, so an ordinary two-note slur pattern scored 1.0 -- the maximum.
    Bow demand is now long slurs (bow distribution), frequent changes between
    slurred and separate, and wall-to-wall articulation marks.
5.  **Speed was counted three times.** `note_rate`, `subdivision` and
    `irregular_rhythm` all rose together with tempo and note value. Note rate
    is now the single speed term; subdivision only registers divisions finer
    than sixteenths of the beat; and the third feature was redefined as
    rhythmic *complexity* (tuplets, dots, ties across beats) rather than "more
    than one note value present", which described most music ever written.
6.  **The tempo assumption ignored the beat unit.** Tempo was read as a
    quarter-note pulse in every meter, so cut time was rated as if it were half
    as fast and 6/8 as if its pulse were the eighth. BPM now refers to the
    notated beat.
7.  **The curve rose too fast from zero.** The old exponential had a slope of
    2.4 points per raw point at the origin, so any single modest demand already
    landed in the middle of the scale. The curve now starts flat and steepens.

Version 3.0 addressed the opposite failure: version 2.0 had corrected the
inflation so thoroughly that it could no longer see the demands that graded
violin syllabi actually grade by. Measured on Mozart K.156 -- a Presto first
violin part -- 138 of 145 measures came out "Beginner-friendly", and the
remaining seven never passed 2.9. Three of the four things a teacher would
name were invisible to the rubric, and the fourth was being read wrong:

1.  **Double stops always read zero.** Chords were flattened to their top note
    before the rubric saw them. They are now carried on the event and rated
    by interval and by whether an open string is involved (`lefthand.py`).
2.  **String crossings were not a feature.** Fluency in crossing is what
    separates a level 3 study from a level 2 one in the ASTA descriptions.
    They are now estimated from pitch under the lowest-workable-position
    model and labelled as estimates.
3.  **Shifts were not a feature.** Register measured only how high the top
    note was, so a line that climbed to fourth position and came back rated
    the same as one that stayed there. Position changes are now estimated
    the same way, and register also counts how much of the measure sits above
    first position rather than only its peak.
4.  **Remote keys cost nothing.** Every syllabus caps the keys a level plays
    in; a key of five flats is a different piece of work from D major on a
    violin. A small feature now says so.

The tempo the rubric assumed was also wrong for most exported files, which is
fixed at the source in `musicxml_source.read_tempo` rather than here.

Nothing here is a validated grade. Anchors for the categories are the level
descriptions of graded string syllabi; the
tests in tests/unit/test_rubric_30.py pin constructed measures to the bands
those descriptions imply.
