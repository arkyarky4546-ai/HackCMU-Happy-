"""Validated musical contracts.

These are the boundary types for anything a model produces. Nothing downstream
accepts raw provider output: it is parsed into these, checked, and only then
used. The rule is to validate external
recognition and LLM output at the boundary, and keep missing values explicit
rather than collapsing them to zero.

Durations are exact rationals, never floats. A measure is accepted only if its
durations sum to what the time signature promises, so a hallucinated or dropped
note is caught arithmetically rather than trusted.
