"""Measure geometry from a scanned page, using classical computer vision.

This module answers the hardest question in the pipeline: how actual
measure positions are obtained rather than estimated by a language model. It
never calls a model. It reads ink.

The pipeline exploits one fact about solo violin notation: there is exactly one
staff per system. That collapses system detection into staff detection and makes
barline grouping unambiguous.

    render -> binarize -> deskew -> staff lines -> staves -> barlines -> measures

Coordinate convention (also recorded in src/schemas/geometry.py):
    Normalized page coordinates. Origin is the TOP-LEFT of the rendered page.
    x and y are fractions of page width and height respectively, in [0, 1].
    A box is (x, y, w, h). Normalization means the browser can position overlays
    with percentages, so zoom and resize cannot desynchronize them from the
    image -- there is no transform math to get wrong.
