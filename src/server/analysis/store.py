"""Edited analyses, held in memory for the life of the process.

This is not persistence and must not be described as such. An edited phrase list
survives navigation and reload; it does not survive restarting the server. That
limitation is real, and the honest place to say
it is here, next to the dictionary that is the whole implementation.

An edit is seeded by deep-copying the source analysis, so editing the example
never touches the lru_cached fixture that every other request reads.
