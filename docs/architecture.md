# Chordially — architecture decisions

Status: proposed constraints; stack and providers are intentionally undecided.
During Plan Mode, recommend the concrete architecture. After approval, replace the decision slots below with the selected implementation and supporting documentation links.

## Required pipeline
Upload → validate file → extract/render pages → recognize notation and geometry → normalize and validate → infer structure/phrases → compute difficulty → select grounded techniques → render score and sidebar.

Retain stable references to the original score throughout. A vision model's prose description alone is insufficient for exact score overlays and passage-derived exercises.

## Decisions to resolve in T00–T02
| Decision | Required resolution |
|---|---|
| Web stack | Choose one stack compatible with deployment and recognition runtime |
| Recognition | Compare a small number of realistic providers/libraries using current documentation; select one |
| Geometry | Explain how actual measure/note positions are obtained and checked, not just estimated by an LLM |
| Rendering | Original scan viewer, coordinate conversion, page/system handling, and optional re-engraving |
| Hosting | Proposed runtime and limits; identify whether recognition needs a separate process/service |
| LLM use | Specify tasks, model configuration, schema validation, and cost/latency constraints |
| Persistence | Define local progress storage and uploaded-file lifecycle |
| Rubric | Concrete feature rules, weights/aggregation, tempo assumptions, and unknown-value handling |

Choose a recommended path, not an unresolved menu. Do not promise a provider emits geometry or MusicXML until verified. If the initial approach cannot support real upload-to-overlay mapping, expose the limitation and propose a feasible scope before extensive UI work.

## Minimum conceptual data contracts
These are contract requirements, not a prescribed library syntax. Convert them into validated schemas during T02.

- Score: id, input kind, title if known, pages, recognition status, assumptions, warnings.
- Page: id, index, source dimensions, rotation/transform metadata, systems.
- System: id, pageId, region, ordered measureIds.
- Measure: stable id, printed label, ordinal, systemId, geometry fragments, meter/key/tempo context, noteIds, recognition quality.
- Note/event: stable id, measureId, rational onset/duration, pitches or rest, ties/slurs/articulation where available, geometry if supported, uncertain fields.
- Phrase: id, label, structural start/end event anchors, practice start/end anchors, region fragments, boundary reasons, uncertainty, user-edited flag.
- Trouble spot: id, parentPhraseId, exact range, supported feature evidence.
- Difficulty: targetId, nullable score, factors, peak where relevant, assumptions, rubricVersion. Display one decimal; reject invalid scores.
- Exercise: id, phraseId/troubleSpotId, techniqueId, exact range, steps, transformed events if applicable, tempo rule, listening goals, success criteria, return step, sourceIds.
- Progress: score fingerprint/id, targetId, user edits, self-reported state, settings, timestamp.

Distinguish stable IDs from printed numbering, which can repeat or be absent. Document range endpoint conventions. Keep pitch spelling and sounding pitch distinct if necessary. Preserve tuplets/ties rather than flattening them into incorrect durations.

## Geometry requirements
- Use normalized page coordinates or a clearly specified equivalent.
- Record origin, axes, source dimensions, crop/rotation transforms, and zoom mapping.
- Attach ribbon segments to measure geometry; never distribute equal widths unless the real measures have equal widths.
- Phrase ranges crossing systems/pages require multiple fragments.
- Note/beat-level boundary editing requires an actual anchor strategy. If recognition supplies only measure boxes, propose and disclose how finer boundaries are supported.

## Reliability boundaries
- Validate upload type, size, page count, and parser failures.
- Validate provider output before downstream calculations.
- Keep missing values explicit and separate from zero.
- Reject exercises referencing nonexistent notes or wrong score IDs.
- Cache or reuse analysis for unchanged inputs/settings where feasible; invalidate affected outputs on edits.
- Label example mode and re-engraved notation explicitly.
- Keep secrets server-side and temporary uploads out of Git.
- Record latency and limits from actual observations; do not claim benchmarks before running them.

## Expected source organization after stack selection
src/app or equivalent: screens and endpoints.
src/components: shared UI.
src/features/{upload,score-viewer,segmentation,difficulty,practice}: product features.
src/server/{recognition,analysis}: adapters and orchestration.
src/schemas: runtime-validated domain contracts.
src/content: technique library and source metadata.
tests/{unit,integration,e2e}: appropriate behavioral checks.
fixtures: reviewed matching score inputs and reference results.

Create these as they become useful; do not fill the repository with empty placeholder modules.

## Decision log

### 2026-09-12 — Stack: pure Python
FastAPI + Jinja2 + vanilla ES modules; Pydantic contracts; pytest and Playwright
(Python bindings) for tests. Chosen because the machine has Python 3.14.6 but no
Node, Java or Docker, and because Verovio, music21, OpenCV and Playwright all
ship Python packages. Consequence: one runtime, one `pip install`, one start
command, and no JS build step — which is worth more than a component framework
on a 9-hour budget.

### 2026-09-12 — Geometry from OpenCV, content from a vision model
The page's measure positions are found by classical CV (staff-line projection,
barline morphology) and never by a model. A model supplies only musical content.
All arithmetic is Python. This is what makes overlays exact rather than
estimated, and it satisfies the requirement above that positions be obtained and
checked rather than guessed.

Consequence: boxes are stored in normalized page coordinates, so the browser
positions overlays in percentages and zoom/resize cannot desynchronize them.
A useful second consequence: geometry computed on a 200-DPI render crops
correctly out of a 400-DPI render of the same page, because normalized
coordinates are resolution-independent.

Three discriminators were needed to separate barlines from note stems, and only
the third made it reliable: (a) a tall continuous vertical run inside the staff,
(b) absence of ink in a margin just outside the staff — stems protrude to reach
their beams, barlines terminate at the staff lines, and (c) whitespace on at
least one side, because an engraver leaves air around a barline whereas a stem
has a notehead welded to it. Detection also supplies a virtual barline at each
staff's left and right edge, since this engraving draws none at a system's start
and the clef, time signature and entire first measure would otherwise be
discarded.

### 2026-09-12 — Transcription unit: a chunk of ~2 measures (revised twice)
The approved plan said one measure per request, to localise errors. Measured
against the real scan, that produced low confidence almost everywhere: pitch is
a relative judgement against five staff lines and a measure crop does not
reliably contain them. Whole systems failed differently — an 8:1 strip is
downscaled by its long edge until the staff is ~100px tall, and raising render
DPI cannot help because the resize happens after rendering.

A run of about two measures keeps the whole staff in frame at an aspect ratio
that is not downscaled at all. Consequence: roughly 31 requests per page instead
of 61, each more accurate. Error localisation is retained because every measure
is still validated on its own and the returned measure count is cross-checked
against the count geometry found — a mismatch marks the chunk for review rather
than silently misaligning notes to regions.

### 2026-09-12 — Validation: arithmetic outranks self-reported doubt
A measure is accepted on whether its durations sum to the time signature, not on
whether the model said it felt sure. Self-reported illegibility is recorded as a
confidence marker instead. Rationale: the recurring ambiguity on this repertoire
is whether a beam group is eighths or 16ths, and that choice changes the total
duration — so a measure that lands exactly on the meter has already been
verified on the very point in doubt. Measured effect: validation went from 44%
to 87% on the same data, while both measures that genuinely failed to add up
stayed rejected. Missing values remain explicit: a rejected measure is unrated
(`None`, never 0.0) and renders as needing review.

### 2026-09-12 — Credential: PRACTICEMAP_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, read explicitly
The client is always constructed as `Anthropic(api_key=...)`. A bare
`Anthropic()` would resolve `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, then `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`,
then an `ant auth login` profile on disk — silently borrowing an unrelated
credential, billing the wrong account, and making "example mode runs without
credentials" untestable, because the app would appear to work with its own key
unset. Consequence: a test asserts no bare construction exists, and the
zero-credential check unsets the app's key while deliberately leaving an ambient
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set.

### 2026-09-12 — Wire format is lean; the domain model is rich
A nested schema (system → measures → notes, with a Literal enum per field) is
rejected by the structured-output layer with "Schema is too complex". The
provider boundary therefore uses a flat list of short plain-typed notes, each
tagged with its measure index, converted to the validated domain types in
Python. Also: `max_length` on a string field is stripped from the schema sent to
the API but still enforced client-side, so an over-long remark became a hard
ValidationError that discarded an otherwise good transcription. Length is
constrained by the prompt instead.

### 2026-09-12 — The browser does no coordinate arithmetic
Every overlay leaves Python as a percentage string and the browser positions it
inside a `position:relative` page element. Zoom is implemented as one CSS
custom property changing the page's width; nothing recalculates, because there
is nothing to recalculate. A unit test rejects any style string carrying a unit
other than `%`, and a Playwright test measures every measure overlay as a
fraction of the page image at two viewport widths and two zoom levels and
requires agreement to within 0.002 of page width -- under two pixels, far less
than the gap between adjacent measures.

Consequence: "annotations survive zoom and resize" is a property of the
coordinate system rather than a behaviour to maintain, and adding a new overlay
type cannot reintroduce drift.

### 2026-09-12 — Ribbon geometry: flush by construction, inside the system band
A ribbon segment starts at its own measure's left edge and ends at the *next*
measure's left edge, not at its own right edge. Adjoining segments therefore
share an edge exactly and no rounding gap can open between them; the run is
stretched to the system's own extent at both ends. Widths still come from the
engraved barlines, so nothing is distributed equally.

Vertically the ribbon sits in the lowest sliver of the system band. That band is
the staff plus margin, clamped by `cv_geometry` to halfway toward the
neighbouring staff, so bands tile the page with no gap between them -- there is
no gutter to draw in. The bottom 13% of the band, inset by 2%, is the whitespace
between staves: "directly below each system" without covering notation.

### 2026-09-12 — A measure click selects the phrase owning its first note
Structural phrase ranges are `(measure ordinal, note index)` pairs and tile the
analyzable music, so a boundary can fall inside a measure and two phrases can
appear in one. The click rule is stated once, in `owning_phrase`: the phrase
containing that measure's first note wins. The other phrase stays reachable from
its outline and from the phrase list, and the measure is marked as both ending
one phrase and starting the next so the split is visible rather than silently
resolved.

A measure recognition could not read belongs to no phrase and returns None. It
is never attached to a neighbour to keep the coverage tidy.

### 2026-09-12 — Unrated is rendered as unknown in three places, not one
Hatching on the ribbon was not enough. A rated phrase can contain a measure
nobody could read, and showing only the phrase's number implied the rating
covered music it was never computed from. The sidebar now names the specific
unrated measure and says which kind of failure it was -- unreadable notation
versus a request that never completed -- alongside the phrase rating and the
statement that the rating comes from the measures around it.

### 2026-09-12 — Rubric 2.0: the rating was inflated by counting, not by calibration
Straightforward first-position eighth-note studies on the Wohlfahrt fixture were
rating **3.2-5.1** — "Advanced Beginner" through "Competent level" for the second
study in a beginner's method book. The cause was not a mis-set scale that a
constant could correct. Seven features were counting the wrong thing, and each is
fixed where it was wrong:

1. **Syncopation counted ordinary off-beat notes.** Any onset not on a
   `1/beat_value` grid scored, so straight eighths in 4/4 read 0.50 and straight
   sixteenths 0.75. It now requires an accent actually displaced: an off-beat
   attack that sustains through the next beat, is tied across it, or follows a
   beat the composer left silent.
2. **Key-signature notes counted as accidentals.** `alter` meant two different
   things in the two adapters — sounding pitch from MusicXML, printed accidental
   from the vision model — so every F# in a G-major import was charged as
   chromatic work. Both are now normalized to sounding alteration at
   `build_score`, where the authoritative key signature is known, and an
   accidental is what differs from the signature.
3. **First position counted as high register.** The ceiling for "no register
   demand" was E5, the *open* E string. First position reaches B5 with the
   fourth finger; the threshold is now B5 and the ramp above it is continuous to
   E7 instead of three steps.
4. **Every slurred note counted as bow demand.** An ordinary two-note slur
   pattern scored 1.0, the feature's maximum. It is now long slurs (bow
   distribution), changes between slurred and separate, and wall-to-wall
   articulation marks. Slur groups are split at each printed `start`, which is
   what separates four two-note slurs from one eight-note slur.
5. **Speed was counted three times.** `note_rate`, `subdivision` and
   `irregular_rhythm` all rose together with tempo and note value. Note rate is
   now the only speed term; subdivision registers only divisions finer than
   sixteenths of the beat; and the third became `rhythm_complexity` — tuplets,
   dots, ties across beats — instead of "more than one note value is present",
   which is true of most music ever written.
6. **Tempo ignored the beat unit.** BPM was read as a quarter-note pulse in every
   meter, so cut time was rated at half its real speed and 6/8 as though its
   pulse were the eighth. `beat_unit` now derives the notated beat, and
   MusicXML's printed metronome mark is read and converted into it.
7. **The curve was steepest at zero.** `10(1 - e^(-raw/4.2))` moved a rating
   furthest for the very first fraction of a point of demand. The curve is now
   `10(1 - e^(-(raw/3.2)^1.22))`, which leaves the bottom flat, rises through the
   middle, and still compresses near 10.

Measured consequence on the same scan, at the same assumed tempo: Etude 2 moves
from a mean of **4.00 to 1.19**, Etude 3 from **5.71 to 2.99**, and the ordering
Wohlfahrt printed them in is preserved with a slightly wider gap than before
(1.71 to 1.80). The page's hardest measure moves from 6.8 to 3.5. No constant was
subtracted and no label was renamed to get there.

Two further consequences worth recording. Slurs are now read from MusicXML at
all — `_note_event` never set the field, so bow demand was silently zero for
every import. And a limitation the wire format cannot express is written down
rather than papered over: a natural sign cancelling a key-signature sharp is
written identically to no accidental, so it reads as the key-signature pitch.

### 2026-09-12 — The coloured unit is a practice section, not a measure
A colour band per measure turned the fixture page into sixty-one slices whose
boundaries fell wherever a rating happened to tick by a tenth. That is a picture
of the rubric's rounding, not of the music, and it made the sidebar answer a
question nobody asked: a player does not practise measure 14 because it is 0.2
harder than measure 13.

`src/features/segmentation/sections.py` groups adjacent phrases into practice
sections while they ask for the same kind of work, and splits where a printed
key or meter change, a real step in difficulty, or a change in the dominant
demand says the work has changed. A user's own split or merge always wins.

Consequences worth recording:

* **The C15 rule is superseded.** A page with no printed signature change used
  to get no sections at all, on the grounds that wrapping it in "Section 1" would
  be a formal claim the notation does not support. The protection is kept — a
  section is labelled by the measures it spans and by demands measured inside it,
  never by a formal name — but refusing to group meant refusing the page a
  primary unit. The Wohlfahrt page now yields five sections where it yielded two.
* **Sections cannot be stored.** They group phrases by difficulty and by demand,
  and both move with tempo, so a section saved at 90 BPM is the wrong grouping at
  160. They are re-derived on every request, exactly like trouble spots. A user's
  edit therefore stores the *decision* — this measure begins a section, that one
  does not — keyed by measure id, which survives re-derivation.
* **Splitting a section can split a phrase.** A section boundary lands on a
  phrase start or it does not land, so asking for a boundary mid-phrase is asking
  for that idea to be two ideas, and `split_section` does exactly that first.
* **Unknown is not a difficulty.** A stretch nobody could read forms its own
  section rather than inheriting a neighbour's colour, and a single unreadable
  measure inside a rated section cuts its band and keeps neutral hatching. That
  is the only thing that interrupts a band.
* **The ribbon still cannot drift.** Bands are flush by the same construction as
  before — a band ends where the next band's first measure starts — so grouping
  changed what a band means without changing the geometry guarantee.

### 2026-09-13 — Hosting: one Vercel Python function
Production runs on Vercel's FastAPI preset as a single Python function, at the
user's request. The pure-Python stack deploys with no build step: a root
`main.py` re-exports the app, `.python-version` selects 3.14, and
`src.config.resolve_work_dir` falls back to the temp directory because the code
is mounted read-only.

Consequences, measured on the first deploy rather than assumed:

* **The bundle is 467 MB of a 500 MB limit.** OpenCV, music21 and PyMuPDF are
  most of it. A new heavy dependency may not fit.
* **No scan recognition.** Audiveris is a Java application and the Python
  runtime cannot run it, so a scan upload fails with its recovery action.
  MusicXML import and the example score are unaffected.
* **Instances are stateless.** Background threads get CPU only while a request
  is in flight, so analysis runs inside the upload request there
  (`jobs.run_inline`). Uploaded bundles and edits are still per-instance memory.
* **Request bodies are capped at 4.5 MB** by the platform, against the app's
  disclosed 20 MB.

A host running one long-lived container would lift the last three. Not pursued:
the deployment brief was Vercel.
