"""Does the rubric agree with an editor who graded this music by hand?

Chordially's 0.0-10.0 scale is its own invention. Nothing in this repository
validates it, and no violinist has reviewed it. But the fixture page happens to
carry an external reference: Wohlfahrt's Op. 45 studies are printed in
increasing order of difficulty, and this page contains Etude 2 and Etude 3. So
there is one thing that can be checked without asking anybody — whether the app
orders those two studies the same way Wohlfahrt did.

**What this establishes, precisely:** ordinal agreement with one editor, on one
pair of adjacent studies, from one page. Etude 3 contributes only 7 rated
measures against Etude 2's 25, because much of the second half of the page could
not be read. It is a real signal and a weak one.

**What it does not establish:** that 1.2 and 3.0 are the right numbers, that the
gap between them is the right size, that the category labels cut the scale in
the right places, or that any of this transfers to repertoire outside a
beginner's etude book. A passing test here is evidence, not validation.

The tests below the ordering ones check something weaker but still worth
pinning: that an absolute scale puts a beginner method page near the bottom of
itself, and that it is not quietly stretched to fill the ribbon.

If this test ever fails, the rubric has started disagreeing with the one external
reference available to it, and that is worth knowing before showing anyone.
